Check out my stuff, if you can i always appreciate help.
With my first project im just trying to build a linear regression and making it more descriptive as I go
Im having a little bit of trouble with it currently, If you take a look youll see that the dimensions on my x and y arent the same amount of dimentions
If I do what I was doing before it wouldnt be descriptive and the regression would just be a 45 degree angle.
